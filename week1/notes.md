## Week 1: Course Introduction

- filling a knapsack is an optimizatoin problems
- NP-completeness
- optimization problem examples: supply chains, sport scheduling, logistics, electrical power system, manufacturing, ...
- complexity class for decision problems
    - can I fill a knapsack for a value above K?
- NP-complete problems have two properties
    - we can check a solutoin quickly in polynomial time
    - if we can solve one NP-complete quickly, we can solve them all
- widely believed to take exponential time in the worst case
